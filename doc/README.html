<p>
<i>Finally a good process manager.</i><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
By default all actions are <b>graceful</b>. Old processes will always be cleanly stopped only once new processes have indicated they are <b>ready</b>.<br>

<pre><code>  &#35; final-pm [--config File|Folder] [Action Select...] 

  -c, --config File|Folder   Default: process-config.{js,json}                                             
                             Load a configuration file. If the path doesn't begin with ./ or /, also       
                             checks parent folders. If you specified a configuration for an already        
                             running application, it will only be applied once the application is manually 
                             (re-)started, but not when a new process is spawned after a crash.            
  --set [app:]key=value      Override a configuration key.                                                 
  -n, --lines num            When using the log action, sets the number of past log lines to display. Up   
                             to max-buffered-log-bytes (see --help-configuration).                         
  -f, --follow               When using the log action, will output new log lines continously as they      
                             appear. Cancel with CTRL-C.                                                   
  --launch                   Start the daemon even if there's nothing to do.                               
  --kill                     Stop the daemon, ungracefully killing any remaining processes. This is done   
                             after all other commands have been sent to the daemon.                        
                             Use 'final-pm --wait --kill stop all' to achieve a graceful stop.             
  --wait                     Wait for any pending actions to complete. This means final-pm will only       
                             return once the queue, new, old and marked generations are empty.             
  --force                    Make final-pm ignore some safeguards. (I hope you know what you're doing)     
  --no-upload                Don't upload new application configurations from config files.                
  --dry                      Don't actually do anything, use --verbose for more output.

<p>
<b>Selectors</b><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
A selector identifies a process or an application.<br>
</p>

<p>
A selector can either be an <i>application name</i>, internal process ID (id=<i>id</i>), or OS process ID (pid=<i>pid</i>). Using <b>all</b> as a selector will target all applications found in the configuration or which are running, depending on the action. An application name followed by /<i>N</i> (slash <i>N</i>) will only select the <i>N</i>-th process of that application. Prefix your selector with <b>new:</b>, <b>running:</b>, <b>old:</b>, or <b>marked:</b> to only target processes in that <b>generation</b>. See the usage examples above.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Actions</b><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
Valid actions are <b>start</b>, <b>stop</b>, <b>kill</b>, <b>scale</b>, <b>show</b>, <b>inspect</b>, <b>add</b>, <b>delete</b>, <b>log</b>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>start / restart</u><br>
<br>
Upload configuration (implies <b>add</b>), then start N=<i>instances</i> processes for all selected applications. When processes are selected this will start one new process for each selected one instead. May cause existing processes to be gracefully stopped when the newly started ones are ready, and will even implicitly stop more processes than were started when <i>instances</i> was decreased in the configuration. Note that this may replace different processes than the selected ones, or none at all, if <i>unique-instances</i> is set to <i>false</i>. In which case the oldest ones of that application will be replaced if <i>instances</i> was exceeded.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>stop</u><br>
<br>
Gracefully stop all selected <i>running/new</i> processes or applications.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>kill</u><br>
<br>
Immediately <b>SIGKILL</b> all selected processes or applications. This works on processes in any <b>generation</b>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>scale</u><br>
<br>
Upload configuration (implies <b>add</b>), then start or stop processes for each selected application until the number of running processes matches configured <i>instances</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>show</u><br>
<br>
Show an overview of (selected) processes.<br>
Use <b>--verbose</b> to also show logging processes.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>inspect</u><br>
<br>
Show detailed information for all selected applications / processes.<br>
Use <b>--verbose</b> to show even more detailed information.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>add</u><br>
<br>
Upload application configurations to the daemon, replacing older instances of the same configuration.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>delete</u><br>
<br>
Delete application configurations from the daemon.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>log</u><br>
<br>
Show process output. Understands <b>--follow</b> and <b>--lines</b>, which work the same as the UNIX <i>tail</i> command.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u><b>Generations</b></u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
Processes are grouped in generations:<br>
The <b>queue</b>, <b>new</b>, <b>running</b>, <b>old</b>, and <b>marked generation</b>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Queue Generation</u><br>
<br>
All processes begin in this generation and remain here until they can be started. Usually they can be started immediately unless <b>max-instances</b> is reached.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>New Generation</u><br>
<br>
The <b>new generation</b> is where processes remain until they are considered <b>ready</b>. A process is considered to be <b>ready</b> on the cluster <b>listen</b> event or when it sends the <b>ready</b> message, depending on the configuration (config: <b>ready-on</b>). Once a process is <b>ready</b> it is moved to the <b>running generation</b>. If a process is asked to be stopped while in the new generation, it is moved to the <b>marked generation</b> instead. If a process exits abnormally while in the new generation, a new one is started (config: <b>restart-new-crashing</b>).<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Running Generation</u><br>
<br>
The <b>running generation</b> is where processes remain until they are <b>stopped</b>. At most the configured amount of processes for each application may reside here. If <i>unique-instances</i> is set to <i>false</i> and the maximum <i>instances</i> was exceeded because new processes were started, the oldest processes will be moved to the <b>old generation</b>. If <i>unique-instances</i> is set to <i>true</i>, each process will replace its counterpart 1:1 instead, and only then will additional processes be stopped if <i>instances</i> is exceeded. If a process exits abnormally while in the running generation, a new one is started (config: <b>restart-crashing</b>). Note that an older process can never replace a process that was started later, ensuring always the latest processes are running even if startup time wildly varies.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Old Generation</u><br>
<br>
The <b>old generation</b> is where processes remain when they should be <b>stopped</b> until they finally <b>exit</b>. A process moved to the <b>old generation</b> is sent the <b>SIGINT</b> signal. If the process does not exit within <b>stop-timeout</b> (default is no timeout), it is sent <b>SIGKILL</b> and removed from the old generation.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Marked Generation</u><br>
<br>
New processes who were asked to stop are kept here, then are moved to the <b>old generation</b> once they are <b>ready</b>. This means the programmer never has to worry about handling <b>SIGINT</b> signals during startup.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u><b>Configuration</b></u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
Configuration may be done in either JSON or JS, as well as environment variables and command line arguments. On the command line configuration keys may be overriden with <b>--set</b> <i>key</i>=<i>value</i>, where <i>key</i> may be any configuration key. To override keys within an appliaction config, prefix <i>key</i> with '<i>application-name</i>:' like so: --set myApp:ready-on="message"<br>
</p>

<p>
Each configuration key can also be overriden with an environment variable by replacing all dashes and colons in <i>key</i> with underscores and translating it to uppercase, finally prefixed with FINAL_PM_CONFIG_,<br>
i.e. myApp:ready-on="message" becomes FINAL_PM_CONFIG_MYAPP_READY_ON=message.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Logging</u><br>
<br>
Logging is done by a logging process started for each application, which will be fed logging output via process.send(logLine). Logger processes are started with the same CWD as your application. Keep this in mind when passing relative paths to loggers. The logging process is automatically started with your application, and is stopped once the last process of your application exits. By default all applications use the simple file-logger that ships with final-pm, but creating a custom logger is very simple. Have a look at the file-logger if you're curious how to create your own logger:<br>
https://github.com/laino/final-pm/blob/master/loggers/file.js<br>
All output of logger processes themselves will end up in the daemon log file (<i>daemon-log</i>).<br>
