<p>
<i>Finally a good process manager.</i><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
By default all actions are <b>graceful</b>. Old processes will always be cleanly<br>
stopped only once new processes have indicated they are <b>ready</b>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Examples</u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<pre>  &#35; Start processes of all configured applications.                             
  final-pm start all                                                            
                                                                                
  &#35; Override configuration settings and start 4 instances of 'worker'           
  final-pm --set worker:instances=4 start worker                                
                                                                                
  &#35; Stop processes by PID                                                       
  final-pm stop pid=43342 pid=3452                                              
                                                                                
  &#35; Stop processes by application name 'worker'                                 
  final-pm stop worker                                                          
                                                                                
  &#35; Stop the first and second currently running worker                          
  final-pm stop running:worker/0 running:worker/1                               

</pre><u><b>Options</b></u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<pre>  &#35; final-pm [--config File|Folder] [Action Select...] 

  -c, --config File|Folder   Default: process-config.{js,json}                                             
                             Load a configuration file. If the path doesn't begin with ./ or /, also       
                             checks parent folders. If you specified a configuration for an already        
                             running application, it will only be applied once the application is manually 
                             (re-)started, but not when a new process is spawned after a crash.            
  --set app-key=value        Override a configuration key.                                                 
  -n, --lines num            When using the log action, sets the number of past log lines to display. Up   
                             to max-buffered-log-bytes (see --help-configuration).                         
  -f, --follow               When using the log action, will output new log lines continously as they      
                             appear.                                                                       
  --launch                   Start the daemon even if there's nothing to do.                               
  --kill                     Stop the daemon, ungracefully killing any remaining processes. This is done   
                             after all other commands have been sent to the daemon.                        
                             Use 'final-pm --wait --kill stop all' to achieve a graceful stop.             
  --wait                     Wait for any pending actions to complete. This means final-pm will only       
                             return once the new, old and marked generations are empty.                    
  --force                    Make final-pm ignore some safeguards. (I hope you know what you're doing)     
  --no-upload                Don't upload new application configurations from config files.                
  --help                     Print short usage guide.                                                      
  --help-usage               Print slightly more verbose usage guide.                                      
  --help-generations         Print help page about generations.                                            
  --help-example             Print a short example application.                                            
  --help-configuration       Print full configuration help.                                                
  --help-all                 Print full help page.                                                         
  -v, --verbose              Show debug output.

<p>
<b>Selectors</b><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
A selector identifies a process or an application.<br>
</p>

<p>
A selector can either be an <i>application name</i>, internal process ID (id=<i>id</i>), or<br>
OS process ID (pid=<i>pid</i>). Using <b>all</b> as a selector will target all<br>
applications found in the configuration or which are running, depending on<br>
the action. An application name followed by /<i>N</i> (slash <i>N</i>) will only select the<br>
<i>N</i>-th process of that application. Prefix your selector with <b>new:</b>, <b>running:</b>,<br>
<b>old:</b>, or <b>marked:</b> to only target processes in that <b>generation</b>. See the usage<br>
examples above.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Actions</b><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
Valid actions are <b>start</b>, <b>stop</b>, <b>kill</b>, <b>scale</b>, <b>show</b>, <b>add</b>, <b>delete</b>, <b>log</b>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>start / restart</u><br>
<br>
Upload configuration (implies <b>add</b>), then start N=<i>instances</i> processes for all<br>
selected applications. When processes are selected this will start one new<br>
process for each selected one instead. May cause existing processes to be<br>
gracefully stopped when the newly started ones are ready, and will even<br>
implicitly stop more processes than were started when <i>instances</i> was decreased<br>
in the configuration. Note that this may replace different processes than<br>
the selected ones, or none at all, if <i>unique-instances</i> is set to <i>false</i>. In<br>
which case the oldest ones of that application will be replaced if <i>instances</i><br>
was exceeded.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>stop</u><br>
<br>
Gracefully stop all selected <i>running/new</i> processes or applications.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>kill</u><br>
<br>
Immediately <b>SIGKILL</b> all selected processes or applications. This works on<br>
processes in any <b>generation</b>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>scale</u><br>
<br>
Upload configuration (implies <b>add</b>), then start or stop processes for each<br>
selected application until the number of running processes matches configured<br>
<i>instances</i>.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>show</u><br>
<br>
Show information about all selected applications / processes.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>add</u><br>
<br>
Upload application configurations to the daemon, replacing older instances of<br>
the same configuration.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>delete</u><br>
<br>
Delete application configurations from the daemon.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>log</u><br>
<br>
Show process output. Understands <b>--follow</b> and <b>--lines</b>, which work the same as<br>
the UNIX <i>tail</i> command.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u><b>Generations</b></u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
Processes are grouped in generations:<br>
The <b>new</b>, <b>running</b>, <b>old</b>, and <b>marked generation</b>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>New Generation</u><br>
<br>
The <b>new generation</b> is where processes remain until they are considered <b>ready</b>.<br>
A process is considered to be <b>ready</b> on the cluster <b>listen</b> event or when it<br>
sends the <b>ready</b> message, depending on the configuration (config: <b>ready-on</b>).<br>
Once a process is <b>ready</b> it is moved to the <b>running generation</b>. If a process<br>
is asked to be stopped while in the new generation, it is moved to the <b>marked<br>
generation</b> instead. If a process exits abnormally while in the new<br>
generation, a new one is started (config: <b>restart-new-crashing</b>).<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Running Generation</u><br>
<br>
The <b>running generation</b> is where processes remain until they are <b>stopped</b>. At<br>
most the configured amount of processes for each application may reside here.<br>
If <i>unique-instances</i> is set to <i>false</i> and the maximum <i>instances</i> was exceeded<br>
because new processes were started, the oldest processes will be moved to the<br>
<b>old generation</b>. If <i>unique-instances</i> is set to <i>true</i>, each process will<br>
replace its counterpart 1:1 instead, and only then will additional processes<br>
be stopped if <i>instances</i> is exceeded. If a process exits abnormally while in<br>
the running generation, a new one is started (config: <b>restart-crashing</b>). Note<br>
that an older process can never replace a process that was started later,<br>
ensuring always the latest processes are running even if startup time wildly<br>
varies.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Old Generation</u><br>
<br>
The <b>old generation</b> is where processes remain when they should be <b>stopped</b><br>
until they finally <b>exit</b>. A process moved to the <b>old generation</b> is sent the<br>
<b>SIGINT</b> signal. If the process does not exit within <b>stop-timeout</b> (default is<br>
no timeout), it is sent <b>SIGKILL</b> and removed from the old generation.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Marked Generation</u><br>
<br>
New processes who were asked to stop are kept here, then are moved to the <b>old<br>
generation</b> once they are <b>ready</b>. This means the programmer never has to worry<br>
about handling <b>SIGINT</b> signals during startup.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u><b>Configuration</b></u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
Configuration may be done in either JSON or JS, as well as environment<br>
variables and command line arguments. On the command line configuration keys<br>
may be overriden with <b>--set</b> <i>key</i>=<i>value</i>, where <i>key</i> may be any configuration<br>
key. To override keys within an appliaction config, prefix <i>key</i> with<br>
'<i>application-name</i>:' like so: --set myApp:ready-on="message"<br>
</p>

<p>
Each configuration key can also be overriden with an environment variable by<br>
replacing all dashes and colons in <i>key</i> with underscores and translating it to<br>
uppercase, finally prefixed with FINAL_PM_CONFIG_,<br>
i.e. myApp:ready-on="message" becomes FINAL_PM_CONFIG_MYAPP_READY_ON=message.<br>
</p>

<p>
<u>Logging</u><br>
<br>
Logging is done by a logging process started for each application, which will<br>
be fed logging output via process.send(logLine). Logger processes are<br>
started with the same CWD as your application. Keep this in mind when passing<br>
relative paths to loggers. The logging process is automatically started with<br>
your application, and is stopped once the last process of your application<br>
exits. By default all applications use the simple file-logger that ships with<br>
final-pm, but creating your own logger is as simple as creating a new<br>
application 'my-logger' which listens to process.on(...) and setting <i>logger</i><br>
to 'my-logger' in your main application. Each logger is fed back its own<br>
output, so make sure you don't accidentally call <i>console.log</i> for each log<br>
line you receive.<br>
</p>
