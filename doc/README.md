### FinalPM  
  

_Finally a good process manager._  
  

By default all actions are **graceful**. Old processes will always be cleanly stopped only once new processes have indicated they are **ready**.  

__Examples__  
  

```
  # Start processes of all configured applications.                                                                                        
  final-pm start all                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                           
  # Override configuration settings and start 4 instances of 'worker'

```

### Options  
  

```
  # final-pm [--config File|Folder] [Action Select...] 

  -c, --config File|Folder   Default: process-config.{js,json}                                             
                             Load a configuration file. If the given path is a folder, also checks parent  
                             folders. If you specified a configuration for an already running application, 
                             it will only be applied once the application is manually (re-)started, but    
                             not when a new process is spawned after a crash.                              
  --set [app:]key=value      Override a configuration key.                                                 
  -n, --lines num            When using the log action, sets the number of past log lines to display. Up   
                             to max-buffered-log-bytes (see --help-configuration).                         
  -f, --follow               When using the log action, will output new log lines continously as they      
                             appear. Cancel with CTRL-C.                                                   
  --launch                   Start the daemon even if there's nothing to do.                               
  --kill                     Stop the daemon, ungracefully killing any remaining processes. This is done   
                             after all other commands have been sent to the daemon.                        
                             Use 'final-pm --wait --kill stop all' to achieve a graceful stop.             
  --wait                     Wait for any pending actions to complete. This means final-pm will only       
                             return once the queue, new, old and marked generations are empty.             
  --force                    Make final-pm ignore some safeguards. (I hope you know what you're doing)     
  --no-upload                Don't upload new application configurations from config files.                
  --dry                      Don't actually do anything, use --verbose for more output.                    
  -v, --verbose              Show debug output.                                                            
  --help                     Print short usage guide.                                                      
  --help-usage               Print full usage guide including actions.                                     
  --help-generations         Print help page about generations.                                            
  --help-example             Print a short example application.                                            
  --help-configuration       Print full configuration help.                                                
  --help-all                 Print full help page.                                                         


```

**Selectors**  
  

A selector identifies a process or an application.  

A selector can either be an _application name_, internal process ID (id=_id_), or OS process ID (pid=_pid_). Using **all** as a selector will target all applications found in the configuration or which are running, depending on the action. An application name followed by /_N_ (slash _N_) will only select the _N_\-th process of that application. Prefix your selector with **new:**, **running:**, **old:**, or **marked:** to only target processes in that **generation**. See the usage examples above.  

**Actions**  
  

Valid actions are **start**, **stop**, **kill**, **scale**, **show**, **inspect**, **add**, **delete**, **log**.  

__start / restart__  
  
Upload configuration (implies **add**), then start N=_instances_ processes for all selected applications. When processes are selected this will start one new process for each selected one instead. May cause existing processes to be gracefully stopped when the newly started ones are ready, and will even implicitly stop more processes than were started when _instances_ was decreased in the configuration. Note that this may replace different processes than the selected ones, or none at all, if _unique-instances_ is set to _false_. In which case the oldest ones of that application will be replaced if _instances_ was exceeded.  

__stop__  
  
Gracefully stop all selected _running/new_ processes or applications.  

__kill__  
  
Immediately **SIGKILL** all selected processes or applications. This works on processes in any **generation**.  

__scale__  
  
Upload configuration (implies **add**), then start or stop processes for each selected application until the number of running processes matches configured _instances_.  

__show__  
  
Show an overview of (selected) processes.  
Use **\--verbose** to also show logging processes.  

__inspect__  
  
Show detailed information for all selected applications / processes.  
Use **\--verbose** to show even more detailed information.  

__add__  
  
Upload application configurations to the daemon, replacing older instances of the same configuration.  

__delete__  
  
Delete application configurations from the daemon.  

__log__  
  
Show process output. Understands **\--follow** and **\--lines**, which work the same as the UNIX _tail_ command.  

### Generations  
  

Processes are grouped in generations:  
The **queue**, **new**, **running**, **old**, and **marked generation**.  

__Queue Generation__  
  
All processes begin in this generation and remain here until they can be started. Usually they can be started immediately unless **max-instances** is reached.  

__New Generation__  
  
The **new generation** is where processes remain until they are considered **ready**. A process is considered to be **ready** on the cluster **listen** event or when it sends the **ready** message, depending on the configuration (config: **ready-on**). Once a process is **ready** it is moved to the **running generation**. If a process is asked to be stopped while in the new generation, it is moved to the **marked generation** instead. If a process exits abnormally while in the new generation, a new one is started (config: **restart-new-crashing**).  

__Running Generation__  
  
The **running generation** is where processes remain until they are **stopped**. At most the configured amount of processes for each application may reside here. If _unique-instances_ is set to _false_ and the maximum _instances_ was exceeded because new processes were started, the oldest processes will be moved to the **old generation**. If _unique-instances_ is set to _true_, each process will replace its counterpart 1:1 instead, and only then will additional processes be stopped if _instances_ is exceeded. If a process exits abnormally while in the running generation, a new one is started (config: **restart-crashing**). Note that an older process can never replace a process that was started later, ensuring always the latest processes are running even if startup time wildly varies.  

__Old Generation__  
  
The **old generation** is where processes remain when they should be **stopped** until they finally **exit**. A process moved to the **old generation** is sent the **SIGINT** signal. If the process does not exit within **stop-timeout** (default is no timeout), it is sent **SIGKILL** and removed from the old generation.  

__Marked Generation__  
  
New processes who were asked to stop are kept here, then are moved to the **old generation** once they are **ready**. This means the programmer never has to worry about handling **SIGINT** signals during startup.  

### Configuration  
  

Configuration may be done in either JSON or JS, as well as environment variables and command line arguments. On the command line configuration keys may be overriden with **\--set** _key_\=_value_, where _key_ may be any configuration key. To override keys within an appliaction config, prefix _key_ with '_application-name_:' like so: --set myApp:ready-on="message"  

Each configuration key can also be overriden with an environment variable by replacing all dashes and colons in _key_ with underscores and translating it to uppercase, finally prefixed with FINAL\_PM\_CONFIG\_,  
i.e. myApp:ready-on="message" becomes FINAL\_PM\_CONFIG\_MYAPP\_READY\_ON=message.  

__Logging__  
  
Logging is done by a logging process started for each application, which will be fed logging output via process.send(logLine). Logger processes are started with the same CWD as your application. Keep this in mind when passing relative paths to loggers. The logging process is automatically started with your application, and is stopped once the last process of your application exits. By default all applications use the simple file-logger that ships with final-pm, but creating a custom logger is very simple. Have a look at the file-logger if you're curious how to create your own logger:  
https://github.com/laino/final-pm/blob/master/loggers/file.js  
All output of logger processes themselves will end up in the daemon log file (_daemon-log_).  

__Default Config__

  const path = require("path");                                                                 
  module.exports = {
